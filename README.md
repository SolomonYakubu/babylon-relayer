# Babylon Relayer: End-to-End BTC Staking & stBTC Minting

This project enables end-to-end simulation and testing of BTC staking and stBTC minting using a Babylon-compatible P2WSH address and real Bitcoin testnet transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed (v16+ recommended)
- Hardhat (for local Ethereum node and contract deployment)
- Bitcoin testnet faucet access

## Step-by-Step Installation & End-to-End Flow

### 1. Clone the Repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/SolomonYakubu/babylon-relayer
cd babylon-relayer-project
```

### 2. Install All Dependencies

Use the provided setup script to install dependencies for both the main project and the relayer:

```zsh
npm run setup
```

### 3. Start a Local Ethereum Node

You must start a local Ethereum node before deploying contracts or running the relayer:

```zsh
npx hardhat node
```

Leave this terminal running.

### 4. Deploy Contracts

In a new terminal, deploy the Vault and stBTC contracts to your running node:

```zsh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

This will create a `deployments/localhost.json` file with the deployed contract addresses.

### 5. Configuration

All configuration is now set directly in `relayer/config.js` for development/testing. No .env file is required. The default configuration is:

```js
module.exports = {
  NODE_ENV: "development",
  BITCOIN_NETWORK: "testnet",
  BITCOIN_RPC_URL: "https://mempool.space/testnet/api",
  BABYLON_WATCH_ADDRESS:
    "tb1qav3dse2x7wpf4njp2qd7rfs8qmwq6c27gmtewq6s9jurnlryc0ys7kzv35",
  ETHEREUM_RPC_URL: "http://localhost:8545",
  ETHEREUM_CHAIN_ID: 1337,
  PRIVATE_KEY:
    "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80",
  CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS: 3,
  POLLING_INTERVAL: 30000,
  MAX_RETRIES: 3,
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug",
  BABYLON_FINALITY_PROVIDER: "fp1",
  BABYLON_LOCK_DAYS: 30,
  STBTC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: deployments.stBTC,
  VAULT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: deployments.vault,
};
```

#### Babylon Watch Address

You can use the **default Babylon-compatible watch address** below to receive testnet BTC and mint stBTC:

```
tb1qav3dse2x7wpf4njp2qd7rfs8qmwq6c27gmtewq6s9jurnlryc0ys7kzv35
```

Alternatively, you can generate your own Babylon-compatible P2WSH address using the provided script:

```zsh
node stake-babylon-p2wsh.js
# Copy the generated address and update BABYLON_WATCH_ADDRESS in relayer/config.js if desired
```

If you need to change any value, simply edit `relayer/config.js`.

### 6. Start the Relayer

In a new terminal, start the relayer:

```zsh
cd relayer
npm start
```

The relayer will not start unless the Ethereum node is running and contracts are deployed.

### 7. Send Testnet BTC to the Watched Address

Use a Bitcoin testnet faucet or wallet to send BTC to your Babylon-compatible P2WSH address.

- Example faucet: https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/
- If you use the default address, stBTC will be minted to the default configured EVM address.

### 8. Observe stBTC Minting

When the relayer detects a valid deposit, it will automatically trigger the minting of equivalent stBTC to the relayer's Ethereum address on the EVM chain. Monitor the relayer logs for deposit detection and minting events.

};
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
